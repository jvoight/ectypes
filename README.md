The following code accompanies the paper "On Galois inertial types of elliptic curves over QQ_p" by Lassina Dembele, Nuno Freitas, and John Voight.

In particular, the code verifies the correctness of Tables 4 and 9, concerning types for elliptic curves over QQ_3 and QQ_2, respectively.

The code was developed to run in Magma V2.27-4, for example as follows.
```
load "check-table-QQ3.m";
load "check-table-QQ2.m";
```
